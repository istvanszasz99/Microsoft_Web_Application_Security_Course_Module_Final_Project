# Activity Introduction (Activity 1)
You are developing the business logic for an e-commerce web application called ShopEase. Customers will browse products, add items to a cart, and complete transactions.

In this activity, you will:

- Create a Product class with specific attributes.
- Develop a Cart class to manage products and calculate totals.
- Use Microsoft Copilot to refine and debug your work.

This is the first of five activities in this project. The code you develop here will be integrated into the Blazor front-end in Activity 2.

After you complete the entire project you will present your application in a peer review by answering questions that review, analyze, and describe the project you have completed.

## Activity Instructions
## Step 1: Set Up a Blazor Project

1. Create a new Blazor WebAssembly project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Add a Pages folder inside the project if it doesn't exist already.
3. Ensure your project structure is organized before proceeding.

## Step 2: Implement the Product Class

1. Create a new C# class named Product.
2. Define the following properties in the Product class:
- ProductID (integer)
- Name (string)
- Price (decimal)
- Category (string)
3. Write a method that prints product details in the following format:
- Product: Laptop | Price: $999.99 | Category: Electronics
4. Run a test program that creates an instance of Product and prints its details.

## Step 3: Implement the Cart Class

1. Create a new C# class named Cart.
2. Include a List< Product > to store products.
3. Write the following methods in the Cart class:
- AddProduct(Product product): Adds a product to the cart.
- RemoveProduct(int productId): Removes a product from the cart by its ID.
- DisplayCartItems(): Prints all products in the cart.
- CalculateTotal(): Returns the total price of all products in the cart.
4. Include a database component in your Cart methods
- AddProduct should save cart items to a local MySQL database called Shop and a table called Products
- RemoveProduct should remove cart items from the database
5. Run a test program that:
- Adds at least two products to the cart.
- Removes one product.
- Displays the cart contents and total price.

## Step 4: Debug and Optimize Your Code Using Copilot
1. Run your test program and check for any errors.
2. If errors occur, attempt to debug manually first.
